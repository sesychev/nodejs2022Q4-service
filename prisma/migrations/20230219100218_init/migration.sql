/*
  Warnings:

  - The `createdAt` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - You are about to drop the `Album` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `Artist` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `Favorite` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `Track` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - Changed the type of `updatedAt` on the `User` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
